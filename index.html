  	<h4> My group focuses on Climate Change for the Topic for Social Change</h4>
	  </br>
	  <h2>Beginning</h2>
	  <p>From scratch we each have our own ideas of what we would share to our own groupmates so then we can decide what we will animate. below is shown the storyboards of each of my groupmates.</p>

	  <h2>Storyboards</h2>
	<p>This is where we each take from our own loopy/google drawings to make our animation ideas</p>
	  <h1>:My Storyboard</h1>
	  <img src="Screenshot_20230118_071355.png" alt="Storyboard" width="700" height="410" img/>
	  <p>My storyboard story was that leaving lights on when you don't necessarily need them wastes electricity consumption and leads to climate change. 
	     The <b>first panel</b> shows a stick figure leaving the lights on before he leaves, which is wasteful. The <b>second panel</b> zooms out to see 
	     other rooms worldwide, and the lights are also left on. When you make a mistake, you're not the only one who has done it or is currently. It is expected,
	     almost like when you decline a call; WAY more than just one person is currently declining a call. On the <b>third panel</b>, it presents the earth; that 
             "everyone" (exaggeration) is wasting electricity... which leads to the <b>fourth panel</b> presenting the earth as abnormally burning. Onto to the 
	     <b>fifth panel</b>, what do we have here? Earth is getting steamed up because of the fossil fuels used to produce electricity! Then finally, the <b>sixth 
	     panel</b> wraps up my storyboard by just saying end, which I thought the earth could explode to teach people in a way they would remember. </p> </br>

	<h1>:Alisha's Storyboard (We chose to animate this!)</h1><br>
	<br><img src="StoryboardbyAlishaPanchal.png" alt="Storyboard" width="500" height="600" img/> 
	<p>In this storyboard, this is the one we chose to do first <b>(we actually wanted to do all three storyboards!)</b> In the <b>first panel</b> 
	 there are a group of thrilled campers, and they huddle around for a campfire they have lit. Now then, they go to sleep with the fire still lit, 
	 unfortunately, on the <b>second panel</b>, the fire grows because of the wind, causing a wildfire. <b>Third panel</b> introduces the now 
	 horribly damaged land, and a very upset hiker whose house was burnt during the wildfire. Going to the <b>fourth panel</b> the hiker still 
	 does not lose hope and he replants + rebuilds his house. To the happy ending of the <b>fifth panel</b> where the hiker is smiling with the 
	 now restored environment and his new house. </p> </br>
