	  <h2>Beginning</h2>
	  <p>From scratch we each have our own ideas of what we would share to our own groupmates so then we can decide what we will animate. below is shown the storyboards of each of my groupmates.</p>

	<h2>:Parth's Google Drawing</h1>
	<p>Since Parth hasn't given me full access to his document yet, I will just say his chunk of problem he wants to address:<b> Manufacturing and Production.</b>
	</br>

	  <h2>Storyboards</h2>
	<p>This is where we each take from our own loopy/google drawings to make our animation ideas.</p>
	 <h1>:My Storyboard</h1>
	 <img src="Screenshot_20230118_071355.png" alt="Storyboard" width="700" height="410" img/>
	 <p>My storyboard story was that leaving lights on when you don't necessarily need them wastes electricity consumption and leads to climate change. 
	     The <b>first panel</b> shows a stick figure leaving the lights on before he leaves, which is wasteful. The <b>second panel</b> zooms out to see 
	     other rooms worldwide, and the lights are also left on. When you make a mistake, you're not the only one who has done it or is currently. It is expected,
	     almost like when you decline a call; WAY more than just one person is currently declining a call. On the <b>third panel</b>, it presents the earth; that 
             "everyone" (exaggeration) is wasting electricity... which leads to the <b>fourth panel</b> presenting the earth as abnormally burning. Onto to the 
	     <b>fifth panel</b>, what do we have here? Earth is getting steamed up because of the fossil fuels used to produce electricity! Then finally, the <b>sixth 
	     panel</b> wraps up my storyboard by just saying end, which I thought the earth could explode to teach people in a way they would remember. </p> </br>

	<h1>:Alisha's Storyboard (We chose to animate this!)</h1><br>
	<br><img src="StoryboardbyAlishaPanchal.png" alt="Storyboard" width="500" height="600" img/> 
	<p>In this storyboard, this is the one we chose to do first <b>(we actually wanted to do all three storyboards!)</b> In the <b>first panel</b> 
	 there are a group of thrilled campers, and they huddle around for a campfire they have lit. Now then, they go to sleep with the fire still lit, 
	 unfortunately, on the <b>second panel</b>, the fire grows because of the wind, causing a wildfire. <b>Third panel</b> introduces the now 
	 horribly damaged land, and a very upset hiker whose house was burnt during the wildfire. Going to the <b>fourth panel</b> the hiker still 
	 does not lose hope and he replants + rebuilds his house. To the happy ending of the <b>fifth panel</b> where the hiker is smiling with the 
	 now restored environment and his new house. </p> </br>
	 <br/>

	<h1>:Parth's Storyboard</h1><br>
	<p>Parth has a terrific story, but I'm afraid it wasn't finished, and I need access. It has something to do with businesses and companies.</p>
	<br/>
    
<h1>What did you work on?</h1>
</br>
<h2>I made the characters for the animation</h2>
<img src="IMG_0628.jpg" alt="Characters for Animation" width="350" height="500" img/>
<p>The hiker, the protagonist, is on the left, and the camper, the antagonist, is on the right. I had to modify them so that they could stand. The hiker was great because he was proportioned well, but the camper kept falling. So we'd use wires, sticks, toothpicks, 
	and hot glue to hold the parts of limbs (just the neck + head) or stand for these two. It was tedious and tiring for my group and me to keep trying to 
	make them stand. I used modeling clay to create such wacky characters.</p>
</br>
<h2>I helped in some parts for the backdrop</h2>
<img src="IMG_0631.jpg" alt="Setup" width="600" height="370" img/>
<p>Listen, I did an itty bitty amount for the backdrops. In the ending scene where I had to make burnt tree stems, then throughout the scenes to initially
	help with coding the lighting we did not even use, drilling holes and modifying the set. I just remembered! I made the hiker's house too.</p>
</br>
<h1>Technology + Code</h1>
<img src="IMG_0630.jpg" alt="Technology at its best >:)" width="600" height="370" /img> 
<p>These are the technology we used, considered, orginally was going to use.
</br>
The two things in the upper part of the photo that looks like a remote control and a little guide, 
that is part of the program we used, Dragonframe. On the bottom left is a LED Red, green, and blue video light. We 
used it instead of the lighting programmable circuit boards with LEDs, because the coding part for the lighting was 
tedious and not good enough. </p>
</br>
<h1>Code used for Programmable circuit boards with LEDs</h1>
<p>Even though we ended up not using these, I will still need to display it for process!</p>
