	<h1>5B Orange Group Animation</h1>
    <h2>By: Sadrah MohammedAli</h2>
  	<h4> My group focuses on Climate Change for the Topic for Social Change</h4>
   
	  <h2>Beginning</h2>
	  <p>From scratch we each have our own ideas of what we would share to our own groupmates so then we can decide what we will animate. below is shown the storyboards of each of my groupmates.</p>
 	<img src="Screenshot_20230118_071355.png" alt="Storyboard" width="500" height="800" img/>
	  <p>My storyboard, my story was that leaving lights on when you don't necessarily need it wastes the electricity consumption and that it leads to climate change. On the <b>
		 first panel</b> it shows a stickfigure leaving the lights on before he leaves,
		 which is wasteful. The <b>second panel</b> then zooms out to see other rooms all over the world as you might say, and the lights are left on aswell. 
		 What I'm trying to say is that when you make a mistake you're not the only one who has done it or is currently. It is normal to happen, almost like when you 
		 decline a call; there is WAY more than just one person declining a call currently. On the <b>third panel</b> it presents earth; 
		 and that "everyone" (exaggeration) is wasting electricity... which then leads to the <b>fourth panel</b> presenting earth abnormally burning. 
		 Onto to the <b>fifth panel</p> what do we have here? earth is getting steamed up because of the fossil fuels used to produce electricity! Then finally,
		 the <b>sixth panel</b> wraps up my storyboard by just saying end, which then I thought that the earth can explode just to y'know teach people in a way they
		 would remember.

<br><h2>one of our groupmates storyboard whose idea we chose, "The Orginal Idea"</h2>

<h2>Character, Set, Mechanical Design</h2>
    <p>I worked on the characters and the lighting. I recieved help from groupmates to modify the lighting and these componets are extermely important for the animation.
	It has helped to make our animation efficent and making it clear for our audience. Others in my group were mainly focused on the background and making the charcaters to move. I programmed the lights with Programmable circuit boards with LEDs ↓↓↓↓</p>
    
<h2>Wildfire</h2>
    <pre>forever(function () <br>{
   light.setBrightness(255)
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setAll(light.rgb(255, 232, 8))
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setAll(light.rgb(255, 206, 0))
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setAll(light.rgb(255, 154, 0))
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setAll(light.rgb(255, 90, 0))
   pause(500)<br>
   light.setAll(light.rgb(255, 0, 0))
   pause(500)<br>
}) </pre>
