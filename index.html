	<h1>5B Orange Group Animation</h1>
    <h2>By Sadrah MohammedAli</h2>
  	<h4> We chose to do a stop motion animation of our social issue we are trying to address: Climate Change
</h4>
    <h2>The Beginning...</h2>
    <p>Climate Change has many parts; pollution, littering, burning/cutting trees down, you name it. But our group has chosen a root of each of the larger chunk of climate change and went to different directions to see which one would be great for the audience to learn about. As you scroll you will see our journey of our animation!</p>
