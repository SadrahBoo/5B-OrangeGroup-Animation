	<h1>5B Orange Group Animation</h1>
    <h2>By Sadrah MohammedAli</h2>
  	<h4> We chose to do a stop motion animation of our social issue we are trying to address: Climate Change
</h4>
    <h2>The Beginning...</h2>
    <p>Climate Change has many parts; pollution, littering, burning/cutting trees down, you name it. But our group has chosen a root of each of the larger chunk of climate change and went to different directions to see which one would be great for the audience to learn about. As you scroll you will see our journey of our animation!</p>

<br><h2>one of our groupmates storyboard whose idea we chose, "The Orginal Idea"</h2>

<h2>Character, Set, Mechanical Design</h2>
    <p>I worked on the characters and the lighting. I recieved help from groupmates to modify the lighting and these componets are extermely important for the animation.
	It has helped to make our animation efficent and making it clear for our audience. Others in my group were mainly focused on the background and making the charcaters to move. I programmed the lights with Programmable circuit boards with LEDs ↓↓↓↓</p>
